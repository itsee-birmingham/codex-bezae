# Codex Bezae XML transcriptions

This repository contains the XML transcriptions created for Codex Bezae (Cambridge, University Library, Nn.2.41) with the full text in Greek and Latin, along with some related files.

They were produced in 2012 by the International Greek New Testament Project (IGNTP, www.igntp.org) in partnership with Cambridge University Digital Library (CUDL). The data in these files provides the 'Diplomatic Transcription' tab on the CUDL website at https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-NN-00002-00041/1

The XML encoding is based on a subset of the TEI-P5 guidelines (www.tei-c.org/P5), described in more detail at http://epapers.bham.ac.uk/1656/.

The present files include some minor adjustments, as notified by users, since the initial publication. These are detailed in the change log at the beginning of the two XML files (one for Greek and one for Latin).
